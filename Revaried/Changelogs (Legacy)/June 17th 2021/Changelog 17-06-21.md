### <div style="text-align: center;">A Variants Release Changelog made on *17/08/2024*</div>
This is a changelog for the *Revaried* commit "[*some new craftings*](https://github.com/isabellawoods/Revaried/commit/6eb6aae7f57d67517ab5dbc6b80b1efa638d702e)", commited on June 17th, 2021.

## Additions
- Potted Sugar Cane and Golden Carrots now have item forms again.
  - Now have a proper 3D model instead of rendering the texture.
- Copper Swords can now be crafted using 2 copper ingots (any `#forge:ingots/copper`) and a stick.
  - Amethyst swords also have a recipe, but it doesn't work due to a typo in the mod id (`cavesandcliifs` instead of `cavesandcliffs`).

## Changes
- Golden Beacons no longer have a glass shell around them.
- Golden Cauldrons now look proper when dropped and on item frames.
- Spawner Minecarts now have uncommon rarity, and now only stack to 1 (was 64).
