Changes the texture of the armored jetpack to match the chest of my "Formal June" skin. This is meant to match the aesthetic of breasts, and was made before I knew about **Female Gender Mod**.

Changes the default Efe skin for a variant of Formal June with long red hair in a black bikini. This was meant for use with **Female Gender Mod**.
