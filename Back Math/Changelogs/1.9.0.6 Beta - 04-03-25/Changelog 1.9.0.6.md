**1.9.0.6** is the sixth version for *Back Math* 1.9.0, released on March 4, 2025.[^1]

## Additions
### Blocks
- Added crates.
  - Crates serve as an early-game version of shulker boxes, being able to be carried around with all its items.
  - These can be crafted using two string and a composter in a "V" shape.
  - These have essentially the same properties as planks.
  - Placed crates can be picked up using shift-right-click, using this will automatically put it in your chestplate slot, or your hand it it's occupied.
  - Crates on your inventory inflict Slowness III for 1 second, unless there's a crate in your chestplate slot.
  - Crates render on your back, and come with a simple chest strap to make it look like you're carrying it.
  - Filled crates show a tooltip like the shulker box, but updated.
    - The crate's tooltip has the ability to show all items by holding shift.
  - Crates cannot be put inside other crates or shulker boxes.
    - Shulker boxes cannot be put into crates either.
  - These use *Revaried*'s stack handling to save and load items.

### Entities
- All termians, collector alcalytes, and angry sophies can now have breasts.
  - The size of their bust is controlled by a new tag called `bust_size`.
  - Their bust size is randomized when they spawn.
  - Breasts can have outfits rendered on top of them, but there's a lot of Z-fighting that occurs.
  - Their breasts are only rendered if the `renderBreasts` config is set to `true` and the *Female Gender Mod* is loaded.

### Statistics
- Added the **"Crates Opened"** statistics.

## Changes
### Items
- Plateforced mid-term armor now has an emissive layer.
  - This is defined by its outfit definition.
  - The items, however, don't have it.
- Fixed a single floating pixel on the plateforced mid-term leggings outfit model.
- Dyed outfit items will now show its colors when worn.
  - This doesn't apply to outfits being rendered on your first-person arm.
- Karate headbands can now be dyed.
  - Updated the item and outfit textures to be white.
  - Karate lucia's karate headbands are still yellow.
  - Renamed to "Karate Headband".
  - Their default color is **#FED83D**.
  - Are now repaired and crafted using any `#minecraft:wool`.
    - The recipe advancement now requires both wool and string.

### Entities

- Termians can now be in different poses, with their hitbox updating accordingly.
  - The conditions to be in these different poses are the same as the player's.
  - They, however, don't get any movement debuffs from crawling or crouching, moving at the same speed as regular walking.
  - Shoving them against a block with air under causes them to enter the crawling position.
  - They can now swim towards their target (still kind of broken as of this update).
- Their capes are now hidden when they're wearing crates.

#### Alcalytes
