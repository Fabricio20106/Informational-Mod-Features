## Additions

## Changes
- Wanderer Sophie and Queen Lucy Pet variants now truly work (except for new data-driven variants).
  - Wanderer Sophie's `Variant` and `variant_reg` tags and QLP's `Variant` tag are now a single tag called `variant`.
  - Old integer-based variants are updated to the new registry-based variants, with the old tag being removed upon loading.
  - QLP variant manager now checks on the folder `queen_lucy_pet_variant`.
- Fixed some Wanderer Sophie variants having a 64x65 texture instead of 64x64.
  - This affected the Entrepreneur, Pajama and Savannah variants.
- Archer Insomnia Sophies can now shoot arrows, and now check for any `#melony:bows` to use instead of only Angelic Bows.
  - They now also more accurately look towards the entity they're shooting at.
- Archer Lucia's crossbows are now enchanted during Sophie Raids, instead of Queen Lucy's.
- Archer Lucia's technical arm pose now changes based on whether they're charging their crossbow or whether it's loaded.
- Queen Lucy Pets can now heal without being in peaceful difficulty.
- *"QLP Daycare"* advancement now works again.
- Zombie Fabricios are now cured using Jantiquified Aljame instead of Golden Apples.
- Capes are no longer render if Termian patrollers have an empty `cape` tag.
- Devil and Angelic tools now show up with their repair materials in JEI's anvil repair category.

### Technical Changes
- *BMRangedBowAttackGoal* now checks for any `#melony:bows` instead of only Angelic Bows.
- *BMRangedCrossbowAttackGoal* now checks for any `#melony:crossbows` instead of only Angelic Crossbows.
- Wanderer Sophie variants now only have a `texture_location` and `slim_arms`.
- Queen Lucy Pet variants now only have a `texture_location` and a `display_name` compound.
