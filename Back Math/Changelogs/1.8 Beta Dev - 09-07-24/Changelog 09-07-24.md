### <div style="text-align: center;">A Back Math Update Changelog made on *01/03/2025*</div>

The **July 9th** update is a version for *Back Math* 1.8.0, released on July 9, 2024.[^1]

## Changes
### Items
- When *Revaried* is loaded, crowns can now be right-clicked to swap them with the item on your head.
  - Since the method that I use to swap seemingly broke when backporting it, swapping crowns may crash the game.
- The tooltips from `super` of titos, totis and queen lucy shirts are now shown first.
- Butter swords now properly check if the `stored_experience` tag exists.
- Devil and mid-term tools no longer set mobs on fire if they're immune to it.
- Devil spareys now set mobs on fire.
- Mid-term sparey now set mobs on fire and gives them Slowness III.

## Technical
### Changes
- Moved most item classes to various different packages.
- Renamed the class *MidTermSpareySwordItem* to *MidTermSpareyItem*.
- Separated the dispense behaviors classes of insoflint and aljansteel and insomnia arrows.
  - These classes are called *IAADispenseBehavior* and *InsomniaArrowDispenseBehavior*.
- The default entry for wanderer sophie variants is now `backmath:yellow_axolotl`.
- The default entry for queen lucy pet variants is now `backmath:current`.

## Tags
### Additions
