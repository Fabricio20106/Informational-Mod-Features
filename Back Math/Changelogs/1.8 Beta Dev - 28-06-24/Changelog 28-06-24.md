## Additions
### Advancements
- Added **3** new advancements:
  - **"Over-Overkill"**: *"Deal 50 hearts of damage in a single hit using Queen Lucy's Summoner Staff."*
    - This is a backport of the [Over-Overkill](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Advancement#Over-Overkill) advancement from Java Edition 1.21.
    - This is a challenge advancement, its parent is *"The Sophie Leader"*, it grants 50 experience points, and its icon is a queen lucy summoner staff.
  - **"Mangaed Mangoes"**: *"Get a Mangaed Mango from Mangaed Mango Oak Leaves."*
    - This is like all other fruit advancements: a task advancement, parent is *"Fruit Trees"*, and icon is the respective fruit.
  - **"The Aljan"**: *"Go to the Aljan through the Aljan Portal Stand."*
    - This advancement essentially replaces the root advancement, with the root advancement having a new look.
    - This is a goal advacement, its parent is *"Hidden from the Empire"* (the new root), and its icon is an aljamic grass block.

## Changes
### Entities
- Warrior sophie now have armor and weapons again.
  - This was because the ids of the warrior helmets were wrong (`<type>_warrior_helmet` instead of `warrior_<type>_helmet`).
